    description: |   
      * Increased wettability alteration of water and oil droplets via passive (surface engineering, surfactants) and active (electrowetting) techniques
      * Conducted experiments and modeled (MATLAB) dielectrophoresis in a 3-liquid configuration
        * Investigated electrocoalescence of water droplets in alkane with interdigitated ITO electrodes
        * Studied effects of interfacial tension, viscosity, inertia, and system capacitance on droplet-droplet interaction
        * Modelled machine learning algorithms to predict electrocoalescence & droplet generation efficiency of microfluidic device
        
        * Studied impact of nanocomposite polymeric encapsulants on packaging of power electronics modules
        * Carried out ANSYS thermal simulations of power electronic module through UT Austinâ€™s supercomputer (TACC)
        * Machine learning analysis of simulation data to understand thermal effect of nanocomposite encapsulants
        * Performed thermal imaging (IR) tests on power electronic modules with liquid-cooled heatsink
