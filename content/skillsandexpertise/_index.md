      * Increased wettability alteration of water and oil droplets via passive (surface engineering, surfactants) and active (electrowetting) techniques
      * Conducted experiments and modeled (MATLAB) dielectrophoresis in a 3-liquid configuration
      * Investigated electrocoalescence of water droplets in alkane with interdigitated ITO electrodes
      * Studied effects of interfacial tension, viscosity, inertia, and system capacitance on droplet-droplet interaction
      * Modelled machine learning algorithms to predict ele
