  Electrowetting (EW) is a widely-studied microfluidic technique to promote
  coalescence of droplets as well as generate droplets. However, analytical or
  computational modeling of the intricate phenomena associated with
  electrocoalescence of water droplets in hydrocarbon media is very challenging.
  Presently, EW-assisted surface electrocoalescence experiments are used to
  train machine learning (ML) algorithms. These comprise an artificial neural
  network (ANN), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and polynomial regression.
  These models are then used to predict the influence of parameters such as
  applied voltage, frequency, electrode spacing, concentration and initial
  droplet density normalized with uncovered area ratio (&delta;<sub>i</sub>/&alpha;<sub>i</sub>), to predict
  nine targets: uncovered area ratio (&alpha;<sub>f</sub>), final droplet density normalized
  with uncovered area (&delta;<sub>f</sub>/&alpha;<sub>f</sub>), and seven droplet density distribution
  (radius) bins.
