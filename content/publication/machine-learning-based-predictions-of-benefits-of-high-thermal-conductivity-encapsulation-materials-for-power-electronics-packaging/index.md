  Machine learning (ML)-based predictive techniques are used in conjunction with
  a game-theoretic approach to predict the thermal behavior of a power
  electronics package, and study the relative influence of encapsulation
  material properties and thermal management techniques in influencing hotspot
  temperatures. Parametric steady-state and transient thermal simulations are
  conducted for a commercially available 1.2 kV/444 A silicon carbide (SiC)
  half-bridge module. An extensive databank of 2592 (steady-state) and 1200
  (transient) data points generated via numerical simulations is used to train
  and evaluate the performance of three ML algorithms (random forest, support
  vector regression, and neural network) in modeling the thermal behavior. The
  parameter space includes the thermal conductivities of the encapsulant,
  baseplate, heat sink, and cooling conditions deployed at the sink and covers a
  variety of materials and cooling scenarios. Excellent prediction accuracies
  with R2 values > 99.5% are obtained for the algorithms. Shapley additive
  explanations (SHAP) dependence plots are used to quantify the relative impact
  of device and heat sink parameters on junction temperatures. We observe that
  while heatsink cooling conditions significantly influence the steady-state
  junction temperature, their contribution in determining the junction
  temperature in dynamic mode is diminished. Using ML-SHAP models, we quantify
  the impact of emerging polymeric nanocomposites (with high conductivities and
  diffusivities) on hotspot temperature reduction, with the device operating in
  steady-state and transient modes. Overall, this study highlights the
  attractiveness of ML-based approaches for thermal design, and provides a
  framework for setting targets for future encapsulation materials.
