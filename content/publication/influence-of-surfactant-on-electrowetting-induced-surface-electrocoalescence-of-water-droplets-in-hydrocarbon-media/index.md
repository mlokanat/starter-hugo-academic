  Electrocoalescence is a powerful technique for separating water from
  hydrocarbons. The present study is a detailed experimental investigation of
  the influence of surfactant (Span 80) on electrowetting-induced surface
  electrocoalescence of micron-scale water droplets in hexadecane.
  Electrocoalescence is studied over a vast parameter space comprising
  surfactant concentration, voltage, frequency and electrode geometry. We
  develop phase maps for various electrocoalescence possibilities and identify
  the parameter space for significant coalescence using dimensionless parameters
  i) modified electric capillary number (*Ca*<sub>e</sub><sup>* </sup>), ii) frequency (&tau;), and iii)
  surfactant concentration (*C*<sup>* </sup>). The effectiveness of electrocoalescence is
  quantified using the parameter (&delta;/&alpha;), where &delta; is the droplet density per unit
  area and &alpha; is the fraction of surface not covered by droplets. 
    
  Strong coalescence (no surfactant) corresponds to &delta;/&alpha; < 10 droplets/mm<sup>2</sup>, with
  best-case &delta;/&alpha; = 1.6 droplets/mm<sup>2</sup>, with no droplets < 20 &mu;m diameter and
  electrocoalesced droplets as large as 750 &mu;mm. With surfactant,
  electrocoalescence weakens; the parameter space for strong electrocoalescence
  progressively reduces with concentration. Nonetheless, electrocoalescence at
  all concentrations results in substantial radius enhancement (after/before
  electrocoalescence); measured ratio ranged from 3.1-6.3 in the parameter space
  of *Ca*<sub>e</sub><sup>*</sup>: 3.3-4.9, and &tau; â‰¤1.25 * 10<sup>-2</sup>. Surface electrocoalescence
  therefore promotes significant aggregation of water droplets over a wide range
  of interfacial energies. This study also characterizes satellite droplet
  ejection (SDE), which adversely affects electrocoalescence due to the ejection
  of 2-10 &mu;m radii droplets. SDE scales with voltage, frequency and
  concentration, and inversely with electrode spacing. Overall, we identify the
  recommended parameter space for surface electrocoalescence for separations and
  microfluidic applications.
