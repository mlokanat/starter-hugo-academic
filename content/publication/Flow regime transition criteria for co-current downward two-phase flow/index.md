abstract: Downward two-phase flow is observed in light water reactor accident
  scenarios such as loss of coolant accident (LOCA) and loss of heat sink
  accident (LOHS) due to loss of feed water or a secondary pipe break, and so,
  it is vital to have a thorough understanding of the flow mechanisms and
  regimes. With this point of view, flow regime transition criteria for vertical
  downward flow for a range of pipe diameters of 24 â€“ 101.6 mm has been developed.
  Several models looked at the radial distribution of the bubbles and the wake
  effect of leading bubbles while others looked into the Kelvin-Helmholtz
  instability seen at the gas-liquid interface. <br><br>

  The newly developed criteria have been compared to flow regime maps obtained via subjective and objective
  means, consisting of air-water data at atmospheric conditions as well as at an
  elevated pressure of 0.2 MPa. The new model is also compared to flow regime
  maps developed with different inlet conditions. Overall, the present model
  showed good agreements with the available data, with the exception of several
  50.8 mm ID flow regime maps of different inlet conditions as well as a
  self-organizing neural network. This study also highlights the need for a more
  objective and consistent flow regime map data for large diameter pipes, the
  identification of cap-bubbly and churn-turbulent flows in these maps, and the
  deviations observed between a supervised and self-organizing neural network
  (SONN).
