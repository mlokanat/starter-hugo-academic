abstract: Competitive wettability in oil-water systems influences applications
  such as oil-water separation and enhanced oil recovery. Here, we study the
  wettability of water (in oil) and oil (in water) on sub-millimeter/micro/nano
  textured surfaces fabricated on a variety of substrates (metals, polymers,
  elastomers). Importantly, all the fabrication processes employed involved
  non-cleanroom-based scalable techniques. Metal surfaces were fabricated via
  wet etching processes and polymer/elastomer surfaces were fabricated via laser
  etching. These fabrication techniques can enable texturing with
  sub-millimeter, micron and sub-micron feature sizes. Wettability was
  characterized by measuring static contact angle and dynamic contact angle
  (roll-off angle). <br><br>

  Several insights into wettability are obtained from this
  work. Firstly, textured metal surfaces with low energy surface chemistry
  showed the lowest adhesion to water and oil droplets. Textured metal surfaces
  coated with Teflon AF were superhydrophobic (in oil) with very low roll-off
  angles (4°– 7°). Uncoated textured metal surfaces were superoleophobic (in
  water) with roll-off angles of 3°– 9°. Secondly, textured polymer and elastomer
  surfaces exhibited utrahydrophobicity (in oil); however not all textured
  elastomers exhibited superoleophobicity (in water). Thirdly, no droplet
  roll-off was observed on any textured elastomer and polymer surface, despite
  very favourable contact angles. This indicates that high contact angles do not
  always translate to superhydrophobicity/oleophobicity. Fourthly, it is seen
  that competitive wettability of a surface can be understood by analysing the
  corresponding water and oil wettability of that surface in an air environment.
  Additionally, the initial state of the surface can be important, as the first
  fluid in contact with the surface fills the porous textures, and dictates
  subsequent wettability. All these findings and insights position this work as
  the foundation for more detailed studies on the development of surfaces for
  specific applications.
